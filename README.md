# GetUWired Assignment: CSS Drop Down

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bfad19e2-a7ca-47ab-9ea7-716c41b355a1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/getuwired-css-drop-down-menu/deploys)

We would like to see your skill set using HTML and CSS. The challenge here is to produce a splash page and dropdown menu out of pure CSS and HTML. You should not use any frameworks, javascript libraries, or other resources other than HTML and CSS. We have provided a digital assets zip that contains 4 views as they pertain to the menu storyboard. Please analyze these scenes for UX/UI and content. Pay attention to active hover states. Please use the menu items // content provided in the storyboard. As a deliverable, please create an html file called yourname-menu.html (please replace yourname with your actual name, we do not literally want the words yourname in the file name). The only image you should need for this task should be linked into your project directly from our website.
